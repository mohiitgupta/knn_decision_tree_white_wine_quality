To run knn model, kindly run python knn.py
To run decision tree model, kindly run decisiontree.py
Currently, i have stored my learnt decision tree of depth 18 into 4 pickle files for each fold.
If you want to create the decision tree again, then the create decision tree function call needs to be uncommented in the main function call i.e. line 237. Also, kindly comment the lines 248 and 249.
The run takes around 4-5 minutes.

The detailed results along with my experiments and intuitions behind my feature engineering is given in report.pdf. Kindly do read it. Happy Coding!
